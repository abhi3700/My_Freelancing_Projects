# Explore Data Visualization tool: Plotly | Part 2

## Background
Hello guys!
So, this is the continuation of my series on data visualization using Plotly tool. Read [part 1]() before reading further.

In the previous article, we learned how to plot a line plot with simple x & y values. The plot had multiple traces with 5 y's (y1, y2, y3, y4, y5).

In Data Science field, Excel is something which is mostly used for record-keeping. So, it is a very fundamental requirement, when it's about adding a button/UI to interact with the data. There are many packages for combining Excel with Python. But, there is a package which is second to none in this regard and i.e. `xlwings`.

Building User Interface (UI) inside an Excel is a part of data visualization in terms of interacting with the data. This is what I feel. Just think why should we create a website or dashboard for a small user interface requirement.

## About Xlwings
* This is a package which gives all the Pythonistas a freedom to create User interface inside the Excel file itself.
* Unlike other packages, it also allows to create custom function like `AVERAGE`, `STDEV`, etc which pops up aftering entering `=` (equal to) sign inside a cell.
* It also gives us the freedom to write additional codes (in Python) and call older written codes (in VBA).

## Installation
* Step-1: Install [Anaconda]().
* Step-2: Install package using pip with `pip install xlwings` in terminal.
* Step-3: Link `xlwings` with Excel by:
	- `xlwings addin install` on terminal.
	- Open "Excel Options" in Excel.
	- Go to the "Trust Center" tab
	- Click "Macro Settings" tab
	- click the "Enable all macros" option
	- tick the "Trust access to the VBA project object model" and click "OK"
	- Go to "Popular" tab and then tick the "Show Developer tab in the Ribbon" and then click "OK"
* DONE!

## Demo 1: Adding a button

## Demo 2: Create a custom function

## Demo 3: Create a User interface
Here, I will show all the images of the final UI created.

For the coding, stay tuned to my Academy -- [Block.Hub Academy Facebook page]() for notification related to the release of course - __"Automate Excel using Python | Series 2"__

## Summary

That's it for now!
